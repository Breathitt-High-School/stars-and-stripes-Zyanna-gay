# Stars-And-Stripes

## Lab Goal :  The lab was designed to teach you how to write a class and to write methods for that class.

     `StarsAndStripes ref = new StarsAndStripes();`
   

  2. use method calls
  
     `ref.printTwentyStars();`

  3. add more methods calls


#### Output will look something like this:
